plan of attack


need to make http://localhost:8008/ look like http://data.glasgow.gov.uk/
need to also make sure that any new features from https://okfstagingfe.cloudapp.net/ not present at http://data.glasgow.gov.uk/ get copied over/implemented


start with homepage

env/src/ckan/ckan/controllers/home index method

read through HomeController class 

note: the get_group() methos is inside the index method()

then read through the header html, thats the first thing you're gonna sort: the dataset icon
